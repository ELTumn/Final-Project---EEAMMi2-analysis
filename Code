**Uploading and subsetting data**
```{r}
EAMMi2 <- read_sav("EAMMi2-CleanData.sav")

EAMMi2_subset <- data.frame(EAMMi2$DisabilityIdentification, EAMMi2$PhysicalDis, EAMMi2$SensoryDis, EAMMi2$LearningDis,EAMMi2$PsychiatricDis, EAMMi2$ChronicHealthDis, EAMMi2$OtherDis, EAMMi2$OtherDisSpecify, EAMMi2$physsymSUM, EAMMi2$stressSUM)

colnames(EAMMi2_subset) <- c("disIdentity", "physical", "sensory", "learning", "phychiatric", "chronicHealth", "otherDis", "otherDis_specify", "physSx_sum", "stress_sum")
```

**Statistical tests**
```{r}
#Hypothesis 1
t.test(EAMMi2_subset$stress_sum[EAMMi2_subset$disIdentity==1], EAMMi2_subset$stress_sum[EAMMi2_subset$disIdentity==3])

#Hypothesis 2
library(car)
Anova()

#Hypothesis 3
cor.test(EAMMi2_subset$physSx_sum, EAMMi2_subset$stress_sum)
```

**Visual representations**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#Hypothesis 1
library(Rmisc)

EAMMi2_dis <- subset(EAMMi2_subset, disIdentity==1 | disIdentity==3) #subset for only people who said they had a disability and reported a type and people who said they did not have a disability and did not report a type
ggplot(EAMMi2_dis, aes(disIdentity, stress_sum)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

EAMMi2_graph <- summarySE(EAMMi2_dis, measurevar = "stress_sum", groupvars = "disIdentity") #tried using summarySE to fix the y axis problem but I don't think it worked
ggplot(EAMMi2_graph, aes(disIdentity, stress_sum)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

#Hypothesis 2


#Hypothesis 3
ggplot(EAMMi2_subset, aes(physSx_sum, stress_sum)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() +geom_smooth(method="lm") + xlab(label="\n Summed Physical Symptoms Score") + ylab(label= "Summed Stress Score \n")
#we will probably need to do more edits to this to make it look better haha but this is a basic graph
```
