Step C Outline

**Outline**
11/2-- start formulating questions about the data and ideas for analysis, and hypotheses. Right now we’re thinking about running ANOVA tests on type of disability (e.g., physical, learning) and stress and physical symptoms. For now, create shared google drive folder (maybe change to GitHub later if we can figure it out)

11/9-- finalized research questions/hypotheses, finalized analysis plan. Start working on preregistration.

11/18-- completed preregistration. Start working on analyses and creation of visuals with data. Data file we are working with is already clean. 

11/23-- analyses and visuals have been attempted, submit knitted file. We anticipate a lot of work going into finalizing our analyses and having some problems/getting some help so start working on that, looking at findings and drawing conclusions. 

11/29-- begin working on write-up of results.

12/2-- completed write-up of results, start working on poster.

12/7-- data and analyses are shared on either GitHub or OSF (haven’t decided yet). Continue to work on poster if not already completed.

12/9-- completed poster and present!

12/14-- completed reflection
