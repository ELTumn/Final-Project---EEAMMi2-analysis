Research Questions:
Is there a difference between stress levels of those who have a disability and those who don’t?
Do individuals with different types of disabilities report different levels of stress?
Is reporting being bothered by physical health symptoms related to reporting higher levels of stress?

Hypotheses:
There will be a difference in reported stress between individuals who report having a disability and individuals who do not report having a disability
Individuals' stress levels will vary depending on the type of disability (i.e., physical, sensory, learning, psychiatric, chronic health, other) they report.
Reported displeasure over physical health symptoms (e.g., chronic pain, respiratory discomfort) will positively correlate with reported stress level.  


Analysis Plan:
Independent samples t-test between disabled and non-disabled participants and stress scores
ANOVA with disability type as IV and stress score as DV
Pearson’s correlation between stress score and physical symptoms score (directional)
